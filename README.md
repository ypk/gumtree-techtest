# Gumtree Frontend Developer Test

Before we conduct any interview we ask all potential front end developers to complete a simple technical task.

Please include a brief description of your solution and what decisions you made in its creation.

**User Story**

Create a browser based version of the game ‘Rock, Paper, Scissors’.

Don't know the game? [_http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/_Rock_-_paper_-scissors_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors)

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Ability to play against the computer
- Ability to simulate a game (Computer vs Computer)
- Ability to restart the game
- Computer generated plays need to be random

**Guidelines**

- The UI can be as simple or as complex as you wish


- We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product.  As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time, though extra gold stars are given to people who get excited and do more because they are having fun.


- We also consider the extensibility of the code produced.  Well factored code should be relatively easily extended. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock> may be a natural extension.


- Bonus points for good accessibility, JavaScript unit tests, Responsive and well commented code

**Technical Requirements**

- jQuery or equivalent library’s are allowed (no plugins) but it is important for us to see that you can write pure JavaScript. We want to see your code, not someone elses.
- Sass / Less are allowed
- The solution should work in IE9+ and all modern browsers, bonus points ie8 and lower

**Summary:**

Alongside this document you should find a few empty files that you can build your solution in. Feel free to change the structure or add new files as you see fit.
