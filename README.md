rock paper scissors test

1. grunt wasn't used as I wasn't performing any tasks & I felt it useless in my case
2. I've used bootstrap framework and I had very little css to code, so I havent used sass; 

However, the site should run as per the documentation. (I.E.8+, uses jQuery and NO Plugins and is responsive)
